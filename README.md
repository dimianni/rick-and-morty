# Rick and Morty Characters App

- The project is built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to retrieve data from Rick and Morty [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
- The app was deployed with gh-pages. More information on the process can be found [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
